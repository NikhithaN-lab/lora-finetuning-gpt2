# LoRA Fine-Tuning for GPT-2

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for efficient fine-tuning of the GPT-2 model. By leveraging **CUDA** for GPU acceleration, the project optimizes the fine-tuning process for rapid deployment. The goal is to fine-tune GPT-2 on a small dataset using LoRA to reduce the number of trainable parameters, making the model more efficient for use in edge devices.

## Features & Achievements
- **LoRA Fine-Tuning**: Used LoRA to fine-tune GPT-2 efficiently with fewer parameters, achieving faster training times.
- **CUDA Support**: CUDA-enabled training on GPUs for accelerated model training and inference.
- **Edge Deployment Optimizations**: Optimized the model for easier deployment on mobile and edge devices.
- **Training Efficiency**: Achieved efficient fine-tuning without compromising performance.

## Challenges Addressed
- **CUDA Integration**: Utilized GPU acceleration for faster training with mixed precision (FP16) support for memory optimization.
- **Efficient Model Size**: Reduced the number of trainable parameters with LoRA for optimized inference on resource-constrained devices.
- **Fine-Tuning on Small Dataset**: Effectively fine-tuned GPT-2 on a small dataset without overfitting.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Installed Required Dependencies**: Installed libraries such as PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and PEFT for LoRA fine-tuning.
2. **Loaded GPT-2 Model**: Loaded the pre-trained GPT-2 model using Hugging Face’s `transformers` library.
3. **Implemented LoRA**: Fine-tuned GPT-2 using LoRA to reduce the number of trainable parameters, leveraging the PEFT library.
4. **Enabled CUDA**: Integrated CUDA to utilize GPU acceleration for faster training.
5. **Evaluated Fine-Tuned Model**: Performed inference tests to ensure the fine-tuned model maintains high-quality text generation.
6. **Model Saved**: The fine-tuned model is saved and ready for further optimization or deployment.

## Work in Progress: Edge Deployment Optimizations
I plan to optimize the fine-tuned GPT-2 model for deployment on mobile and edge devices. Upcoming work includes:

- **ONNX Conversion**: Converting the fine-tuned model into **ONNX** format for cross-platform compatibility.
- **TensorRT Optimization**: Preparing the model for NVIDIA’s **TensorRT** optimizations to enhance real-time inference on GPUs and edge devices.
- **Quantization**: Testing FP16 vs. INT8 quantization for memory efficiency and inference speed improvements.

## Next Steps
1. **Convert to ONNX**: Convert the fine-tuned GPT-2 model into ONNX format for deployment across various platforms.
2. **TensorRT Optimization**: Optimize the ONNX model using TensorRT to enhance performance and reduce latency.
3. **Benchmarking**: Compare the inference speed between the fine-tuned model, the ONNX model, and the TensorRT-optimized model.
4. **Mobile Deployment**: Deploy the optimized model on mobile/edge devices and measure performance improvements.
